But there is a long tradition of Ashkenazi Jewish vegetarianism – one a new crop of chefs is reviving.

About an hour has gone by: time to take the gefilte fish and carrots out of the boiling water. In another pot, I&#x27;ve got potatoes and pickles simmering in stock and brine; I stir in a hefty dollop of sour cream to cut the acidity and top the soup  with a sprinkling of fresh chopped dill. Tomorrow, I&#x27;ll be cooking a leek frittata for breakfast and schnitzel breaded with matzo meal for dinner.

I&#x27;m swimming in shtetl nostalgia – Ashkenazi Jews have been making versions of these recipes for decades. Gefilte fish (an appetiser made from poached fish), for example, has been a favourite since they first settled on the banks of the German Rhine in the 11th Century.

But there&#x27;s a key difference. I&#x27;m making vegetarian versions of these dishes. And, in doing so, I know I&#x27;m closer to the traditions of my ancestors than I would be with the stacked pastrami sandwiches that have become the standard-bearer of Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine.

For my Ashkenazi ancestors, the towers of meat you can find at the Jewish deli were nonexistent. Instead, their kitchens would be full of fresh, regional and seasonal vegetables, an assortment of pickles and, if they were lucky, some dairy. Meat and fish were expensive rarities until the industrialisation of meat production in the early 20th Century. That&#x27;s why the gefilte fish I&#x27;m making now is a vegetarian imitation adapted from a century-old recipe using a purée of salsify (oyster plant), cashews and onion mixed with eggs and matzo meal, shaped into disc-like quenelles for poaching, then topped with one sliced carrot and sinus-clearing horseradish.

Instead of veal, the schnitzel is a cut of celeriac root covered in flour, egg wash and matzo meal that browns after a few minutes on a hot skillet – as instructed by an 84-year-old recipe.

It may come as a surprise to fans of the Jewish deli, but the values of vegetarianism have long been espoused and cherished by Ashkenazi Jewish cooks. And these values are returning from the sidelines. From Los Angeles, California and Cleveland, Ohio, to New York&#x27;s Lower East Side and Brooklyn – where most Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants first settled and many sold pickles from pushcarts – a new generation of Jewish sandwich slingers and cookbook authors are promoting &quot;plant-forward&quot; eating.

In doing so, they&#x27;re embodying many of the beliefs spelled out by the likes of chef Fania Lewando in her 1938 cookbook The Vilna Vegetarian – and revolutionising modern Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine by taking it back to its roots (pun intended).

The Vilna Vegetarian

Eve Jochnowitz is a culinary ethnographer based in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village where she grew up. She published a translation of Lewando&#x27;s Yiddish-language cookbook in 2015, including around 400 vegetarian recipes.  

There are sections expected of most any cookbook, like salads – with earthy dishes based on radishes and red cabbage – and soups ranging from a puréed carrot soup to bran borscht. Then come the unmistakably Jewish sections, like latkes (10 kinds) and Passover foods. There is even a section labelled &quot;Kugels with Cholents&quot;, with 11 different ways to make the traditional Jewish casserole to go with the Sabbath stew left to simmer overnight – that way, it&#x27;s ready for Shabbat lunch without lifting a finger.

In the foreword to The Vilna Vegetarian, celebrated cookbook author Joan Nathan writes that the Yiddish and German kosher cookbooks of the 1930s offered vegetarian recipes in response to anti-Semitic laws outlawing the traditional Jewish ritual of slaughtering animals. But vegetarianism in Jewish cuisine goes back as far as the Talmud, the compilation of rabbinic debate on Jewish law, philosophy and biblical interpretation that was produced between the 3rd and 8th Centuries.

Nora Rubel is co-founder of the vegan Jewish deli Grass Fed in Rochester, New York, and a Jewish studies professor at the University of Rochester where she researches American Jewish culture, culinary history and religion. She noted that the Talmud allows for the use of a beet on a Passover Seder plate instead of a shank bone. Knowledge like this, Rubel said, can embolden Jewish vegetarians.

&quot;This shows us that [our ancestors] were already talking about this a long time ago,&quot; Rubel said. &quot;This is part of our culinary lineage.&quot;

Centuries later, in 1938, Lewando continued that lineage in what is today Vilnius, Lithuania, where she owned a kosher dairy restaurant, ran a kosher cooking school and supervised a vegetarian kosher kitchen on an ocean liner that travelled between Gydnia, Poland, and New York City. In the introduction to her cookbook, she wrote of the importance of being resourceful and never throwing anything away because &quot;everything can be made into food&quot;.

She also connected vegetarianism to Jewish values.

&quot;From the humanitarian principle of &#x27;tsar baaley khayim&#x27; (not killing living creatures), it would be desirable to replace meat with a purely vegetarian cuisine,&quot; Lewando wrote. (It&#x27;s worth noting that Lewando&#x27;s translation is contested, with some saying it means not causing undue pain to animals, given that meat also plays a role in historic Jewish culture.)

Land of abundance

What happened between the 1930s and today? After all, salads full of garden vegetables and resourceful soups are hardly what come to mind when people think of Ashkenazi Jewish food.

&quot;Meat was super cheap in America,&quot; said Jeffrey Yoskowitz, Jewish food expert and the co-founder of Papaya, a plant-based food delivery platform featuring meals from top chefs at vegan and non-vegan restaurants. &quot;The idea of eating this giant mega sandwich of beef is just the ultimate symbol of abundance and the affluence of America.&quot;

In fact, that abundance made not eating meat a mockable offence, said Jochnowitz. &quot;There is a Yiddish saying: &#x27;Dos beste milkhiks iz a shtikl fleysh&#x27;,&quot; she said. &quot;The best dairy is a piece of meat.&quot;" class="blogstyles__StyledImg-sc-1ltdgwa-2 fBfHGW"/><div class="blogstyles__TextContainer-sc-1ltdgwa-4 iSVTIG"><div class="blogstyles__StyledText-sc-1ltdgwa-3 jZuwa"><p>Pastrami, schnitzel, gefilte fish: Jewish food isn&#x27;t often known as plant-based.
