In the story, each sister is unique: one stands tall, her long yellow hair blows in the wind. Another wears a bright yellow dress and is known to run off on her own. The third is so young she can only crawl along the ground. Only by working together are they able to flourish and grow – so the trio became inseparable.\n\nBut the sisters aren't people. They're crops: corn, squash and beans. And the story isn't just an old myth about cooperation, now shared with tourists who visit the Ekionkiestha' National Longhouse at the Huron-Wendat Museum, just outside Quebec City. It's a message from the ancestors of the First Nation that teaches modern Wendat people about the ancient, life-sustaining foods – and a companion planting technique called intercropping that's so important it survived all the turmoil and cultural losses that came with colonisation.\n\n\"Before our dispossession, Lake Huron was our home for centuries,\" said Johanne Paquet Sioui, a Wendat seed keeper and farmer. With arable land that stretched from Georgian Bay on Lake Huron to the shores of Lake Simcoe, the region known historically as Wendake or Huronia supported 30,000 to 35,000 Wendat people. \n\nThey lived in settlements surrounded by defensive palisades, with each village containing as many as 100 longhouses. Shared by four or five families, the large rectangular homes were built from log frames and covered with rounded roofs and walls made of cedar, fir or spruce bark. Windowless – the longhouses had two entrances, one at each end. Inside, the walls would have been lined with shelf-like beds that had food storage above them and wood piles beneath. Running in a row down the centre would have been cooking fires where a one-pot meal made from corn, beans and squash, called sagamité, may have simmered.\n\nBack then, the three sisters made up some 60-80% of the Wendat diet, and the Wendat culture, like many others across North America, was centred on the plants' cultivation. Sioui said the men cleared the land and then the women and children would build up dirt piles and plant the beans. As the small seedlings began to grow, the farmers returned and placed corn kernels in the centre of the mounds (theories vary on whether it was corn or beans that were planted first). Next, winter squash was sown. As the plants matured, the cornstalks served as bean poles while the large squash leaves shaded the soil, creating a microclimate that preserved moisture and inhibited weeds.\n\nToday we know that planting corn, beans and squash together results in better disease resistance, less reliance on fertilisers and improved crop yields. But for the Wendat people, it was a sacred act that respected ancient teachings. \"We don't pray, instead we're taught to make thanksgiving,\" said Sioui. \"For everything we are grateful for, we learn we have a responsibility to keep it that way.\"\n\nAt the end of the growing season, the vegetables were harvested and stored for winter. Corn and beans were dried and kept in the longhouse in bark or wooden containers. As far as possible, everything was used. Corn husks were braided for rope and twine, or used as filling for pillows and mattresses. The best seeds were selected and saved for the next season's planting by the seed keepers, whose job it is to collect and protect seeds.\n\nBut by 1650, the farms and village sites of Huronia or Wendake were empty. Thousands of Huron-Wendat people had succumbed to diseases including smallpox, ­influenza and measles, while others perished in the French and Iroquois Wars – a series of territorial and trade battles between the French, Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), English and other First Nations.\n\nOnly some 500 Huron-Wendat are said to have survived and escaped, and for 200 years, they didn't have a homeland. \"The old and the young died. They lost almost everything… their homes, their culture, their skills,\" said Sioui. What they didn't lose were their seeds, and every year, as they moved across the landscape, the men prepared the land, and the women planted the three sisters. And every year, after the harvest, the seed keepers saved seeds for the next spring.\n\nThen, in 1853, the Huron-Wendat People were allotted reserve land; according to the Indian Act, it measured three by five miles and was located at the edge of Quebec City in what was then Lower Canada. They had a home, but as on most reserves in Canada, there was no arable space provided for agriculture or other food production.\n\n\"The last garden we harvested was in 1853,\" said Sioui.\n\nThe three sisters don't just nurture the soil and each other. According to Sioui, the three vegetables combined are exceptionally nutritious. Studies say that a diet based on maize, beans and squash can  meet peoples' basic energy and protein requirements and can also help guard against diabetes. They're also high in antioxidants and provide trace minerals and folate, which guards against birth defects. But with the loss of farmland and the introduction of European staples including sugar, flour and butter, this ancient diet was almost completely replaced. The results were catastrophic.\n\nElders say that the loss of traditional foods is almost as damaging as the loss of language. Losing food systems severs a people's relationship with the natural world, the land, the plants and the seasons. It also takes away the intergenerational skills and celebrations that revolve around food sovereignty: spreading seeds or saving them, gathering together for harvests or for feasts.\n","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/2cFHHTiIoCmlaECK11QXyP/57ab241a69a2f14c687c473caeb4d85a/fall.png"}}},{"content":{"sys":{"id":"5Zrzwz06ZDXJkg4pzcL1OM"},"slug":"/5","title":"A return to vegetarian Jewish cuisine","description":"Pastrami, schnitzel, gefilte fish: Jewish food isn't often known as plant-based. But there is a long tradition of Ashkenazi Jewish vegetarianism – one a new crop of chefs is reviving.\n\nAbout an hour has gone by: time to take the gefilte fish and carrots out of the boiling water. In another pot, I've got potatoes and pickles simmering in stock and brine; I stir in a hefty dollop of sour cream to cut the acidity and top the soup  with a sprinkling of fresh chopped dill. Tomorrow, I'll be cooking a leek frittata for breakfast and schnitzel breaded with matzo meal for dinner.\n\nI'm swimming in shtetl nostalgia – Ashkenazi Jews have been making versions of these recipes for decades. Gefilte fish (an appetiser made from poached fish), for example, has been a favourite since they first settled on the banks of the German Rhine in the 11th Century.\n\nBut there's a key difference. I'm making vegetarian versions of these dishes. And, in doing so, I know I'm closer to the traditions of my ancestors than I would be with the stacked pastrami sandwiches that have become the standard-bearer of Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine.\n\nFor my Ashkenazi ancestors, the towers of meat you can find at the Jewish deli were nonexistent. Instead, their kitchens would be full of fresh, regional and seasonal vegetables, an assortment of pickles and, if they were lucky, some dairy. Meat and fish were expensive rarities until the industrialisation of meat production in the early 20th Century. That's why the gefilte fish I'm making now is a vegetarian imitation adapted from a century-old recipe using a purée of salsify (oyster plant), cashews and onion mixed with eggs and matzo meal, shaped into disc-like quenelles for poaching, then topped with one sliced carrot and sinus-clearing horseradish.\n\nInstead of veal, the schnitzel is a cut of celeriac root covered in flour, egg wash and matzo meal that browns after a few minutes on a hot skillet – as instructed by an 84-year-old recipe.\n\nIt may come as a surprise to fans of the Jewish deli, but the values of vegetarianism have long been espoused and cherished by Ashkenazi Jewish cooks. And these values are returning from the sidelines. From Los Angeles, California and Cleveland, Ohio, to New York's Lower East Side and Brooklyn – where most Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants first settled and many sold pickles from pushcarts – a new generation of Jewish sandwich slingers and cookbook authors are promoting \"plant-forward\" eating.\n\nIn doing so, they're embodying many of the beliefs spelled out by the likes of chef Fania Lewando in her 1938 cookbook The Vilna Vegetarian – and revolutionising modern Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine by taking it back to its roots (pun intended).\n\nThe Vilna Vegetarian\n\nEve Jochnowitz is a culinary ethnographer based in New York City's Greenwich Village where she grew up. She published a translation of Lewando's Yiddish-language cookbook in 2015, including around 400 vegetarian recipes.  \n\nThere are sections expected of most any cookbook, like salads – with earthy dishes based on radishes and red cabbage – and soups ranging from a puréed carrot soup to bran borscht. Then come the unmistakably Jewish sections, like latkes (10 kinds) and Passover foods. There is even a section labelled \"Kugels with Cholents\", with 11 different ways to make the traditional Jewish casserole to go with the Sabbath stew left to simmer overnight – that way, it's ready for Shabbat lunch without lifting a finger.\n\nIn the foreword to The Vilna Vegetarian, celebrated cookbook author Joan Nathan writes that the Yiddish and German kosher cookbooks of the 1930s offered vegetarian recipes in response to anti-Semitic laws outlawing the traditional Jewish ritual of slaughtering animals. But vegetarianism in Jewish cuisine goes back as far as the Talmud, the compilation of rabbinic debate on Jewish law, philosophy and biblical interpretation that was produced between the 3rd and 8th Centuries.\n\nNora Rubel is co-founder of the vegan Jewish deli Grass Fed in Rochester, New York, and a Jewish studies professor at the University of Rochester where she researches American Jewish culture, culinary history and religion. She noted that the Talmud allows for the use of a beet on a Passover Seder plate instead of a shank bone. Knowledge like this, Rubel said, can embolden Jewish vegetarians.\n\n\"This shows us that [our ancestors] were already talking about this a long time ago,\" Rubel said. \"This is part of our culinary lineage.\"\n\nCenturies later, in 1938, Lewando continued that lineage in what is today Vilnius, Lithuania, where she owned a kosher dairy restaurant, ran a kosher cooking school and supervised a vegetarian kosher kitchen on an ocean liner that travelled between Gydnia, Poland, and New York City. In the introduction to her cookbook, she wrote of the importance of being resourceful and never throwing anything away because \"everything can be made into food\".\n\nShe also connected vegetarianism to Jewish values.\n\n\"From the humanitarian principle of 'tsar baaley khayim' (not killing living creatures), it would be desirable to replace meat with a purely vegetarian cuisine,\" Lewando wrote. (It's worth noting that Lewando's translation is contested, with some saying it means not causing undue pain to animals, given that meat also plays a role in historic Jewish culture.)\n\nLand of abundance\n\nWhat happened between the 1930s and today? After all, salads full of garden vegetables and resourceful soups are hardly what come to mind when people think of Ashkenazi Jewish food.\n\n\"Meat was super cheap in America,\" said Jeffrey Yoskowitz, Jewish food expert and the co-founder of Papaya, a plant-based food delivery platform featuring meals from top chefs at vegan and non-vegan restaurants. \"The idea of eating this giant mega sandwich of beef is just the ultimate symbol of abundance and the affluence of America.\"\n\nIn fact, that abundance made not eating meat a mockable offence, said Jochnowitz. \"There is a Yiddish saying: 'Dos beste milkhiks iz a shtikl fleysh',\" she said. \"The best dairy is a piece of meat.\"","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/59h2y3w059L3ypSCTS0b60/a2a4c6da2f2109f5a84e412d6aa65b36/jewishfood.png"}}},{"content":{"sys":{"id":"BIvUGDltta87kdU4utaUY"},"slug":"/2","title":"An epic food journey in the Arctic Circle","description":"Fabled for its off-the-beaten track location, gourmet restaurant Koks is now even harder to reach.

After school ended for the day, she would go home, finish her homework and be beckoned into the kitchen with the other girls. The tasks were menial but had to be handled delicately, like carefully slicing fresh makrut lime leaves or dodging splashes of burning gravy or syrup while stirring a pot of curry or pineapple jam over a flame.\n\nPeranakan cooking, a Southeast Asian cuisine with multicultural roots, created and popularised by nyonyas (Peranakan women), is often labour-intensive and time-consuming. Sometimes it takes several days to prepare one dish. Take ayam buah keluak (chicken and black nuts stew) for instance. The buah keluak, a nut native to Malaysian and Indonesian mangroves, has to be soaked in water for three to five days, changing the water every day, before extracting the black paste inside the nuts.\n\nThe women in Ng's family would also clean and cut whole fresh chickens, and use a mortar and pestle to pound ingredients such as turmeric, lemongrass and shallots to make a rempah (spice paste). But Ng enjoyed the work, even when her grandmother chided her if there was a burnt smell coming from the pot. \"I learnt to be meticulous and patient,\" Ng said. \n\nHer grandmother had mastered cooking under Ng's great-grandmother, who had learned from her great-great-grandmother. \"It was always mothers,\" Ng said.\n\nNow living in Singapore, Ng is passing on the secrets of her family recipes. \"Whenever I cook, it brings back memories of spending time in the kitchen with my grandmother.\" On weekends, the financial services executive holds classes at her home, teaching eager adults how to make appetisers, gravies, dips, desserts and snacks, from the aromatic nasi ulam (a rice salad with mixed herbs) to a melt-in-your-mouth kueh salat (a cake made with glutinous rice and pandan custard).\n\nWhenever I cook, it brings back memories of spending time in the kitchen with my grandmother\n\nPeranakan food is known to be colourful and chockfull of local herbs and spices that give the eye-catching dishes their complex flavours. They can be spicy, salty and slightly sweet at the same time, like babi pongteh (pork braised with fermented soybean gravy); or sour, spicy and bursting with umami such as ikan asam pedas (spicy tamarind fish). Since most dishes require the ingredients to stew for long periods of time, all their flavours are released into the gravies, creating a tasty, indulgent mixture you can pour over rice or noodles, or dip your bread into.","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/2bmEKzCGkdXhbIjtrVM0Ve/5a3f3acf0b8f493472bc09ddb2553ac7/rice.png"}}},{"content":{"sys":{"id":"69FFLxqwrLoLWn9PfhzRws"},"slug":"/6","title":"Why we'll soon be drinking Arctic wine","description":"Once seen as experimental and at the fringe of what's possible, a commercial wine industry in regions just below the Arctic circle is taking advantage of the warmer summers.\n\nWhen Emma Serner met and fell in love with Italian enologist Andrea Guerra in Tuscany, the young couple began to dream about starting their own vineyard together. \"We were both very invested in climate topics and environmental questions,\" said Serner, who was interning at the vineyard Guerra was working at. \"But I really felt like it would be impossible to do in the south of Europe. Climate change really has become drastic and it's affecting agriculture in a very severe way.\"\n\nIn recent years, heat waves, drought and smoke from wildfires have wreaked havoc on vineyards around Europe, making it increasingly difficult to produce the same legacy wines that producers have consistently been churning out for centuries. Last year, southern European winemakers faced historically low harvests due to bad weather.\n\nSerner suggested heading up to her home country of Sweden and setting up a vineyard on the island of Gotland, a southern province with warm, mild summers where her grandmother owned a summerhouse.\n\nBut Guerra wasn't sure. \"He had never heard of Gotland,\" Serner said, \"He asked, 'What is it? Are there polar bears?' You know, all the southern European myths about Sweden came up. And then he started asking very intricate questions about soil composition, climate, air humidity, UV radiation and the average temperature. After quite a while, he said he was still very sceptical, but there is potential.\"\n\nThey took a leap of faith, and today, Serner and Guerra are the co-founders of Långmyre Vineri – a 10-acre vineyard on Gotland, with a collection of 26,000 vines. They are part of a small yet growing cohort of Swedish winemakers whose collective land area spans between 370 to 500 acres. \"It was really just a fantasy,\" admitted Serner. \"But things kind of escalated quite quickly.\"\n\nAs the world gets hotter, cool climate viticulture is becoming increasingly attractive. Since the late 1800s, the average global temperature has risen about 1C, which might seem incremental but has significant repercussions for the wine industry. \"A 2C global increase in temperature could remove 55% of wine growing regions worldwide and 4C could remove over 70% of these regions from production,\" said Debbie Inglis, the director of the Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute in Canada, citing a 2020 study.\n\nOnce seen as experimental and at the fringe of what's possible, a commercial wine industry in regions just below the Arctic circle is taking advantage of the warmer summers. In the last decade, southern Sweden, Denmark, Nova Scotia in Canada and even parts of Norway have become emerging wine destinations, a development spurred by hotter summers and the introduction of disease-resistant hybrid grape varieties that can resist the frigid winters.\n\n\"During the last 20 years, we've had the opportunity to harvest grapes on yearly basis,\" said Lotta Nordmark, a horticulturist and researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, about the Swedish wine industry. \"In earlier years when you tried to grow wine in Sweden, it wasn't guaranteed that you could get a good harvest every year.\"\n\nSweden has been dabbling in viticulture since 1999, but wine makers didn't start hitting their stride until around 2010 when cold-hardy hybrid grapes like Solaris were introduced via Germany, according to Sveneric Svensson, the chairman of the Swedish Wine Association. \"Solaris was born in Frankfurt, but it's really too warm for it there,\" Svensson said. \"In Sweden, because it's colder, it's got a slow and nice development that doesn't ripen that brutally.\"\n\nFrom an environmental standpoint, hybrid grapes are disease resistant cultivars that don't require much or any pesticides or fungicides – the main reason why Serner and Guerra decided to set up shop in southern Sweden instead of Italy. \"We firmly believe that these hybrid varieties are the future of sustainable wine growing,\" said Serner. \"People are so fixated with making the same wine from the same varieties, even though the recipe that was written 200 years ago was made when the world looked different.\"\n\nIn old wine countries like Italy and France, there are strict appellation rules dictating what type of grapes can be grown and where. But the problem is that with the changing climate, some of these legacy grapes no longer thrive as well as they did before.\n\n\"If you grow the conventional varieties, you can try to be organic, but you will have to spray at one point because they will get sick,\" said Serner. \"We didn't want to be locked in that situation.\" Many emerging wine regions, on the other hand, do not have regulations on grapes – a freedom that many winegrowers find to be more sustainable in the long run.\n\nOn Sweden's largest vineyard, Arilds Vingård, head winemaker Joe Roman estimates that 90% of their grapes are of the Solaris variety, which can be made into bright white or sparkling wines with high levels of acidity. Roman, who grew up in California and studied wine making in Oregon, also chose to work in the Swedish wine industry because of its predilection for hybrids. \"It's much better for the planet. You spray much less,\" he said.\n\nLocated on a peninsula in southern Sweden, Arilds looks like a classic European vineyard. Rows of perfectly manicured vines sit neatly on 74 acres of land; a cluster of glamping tents for guests is situated in the middle. Near the entrance, a restaurant and bar is packed with visitors in sundresses and cargo pants sipping on a range of estate-made white, sparkling and rosé wines.\n\nAnd they're not the only ones offering an all-inclusive experience. Further north in the neighbouring province is Ästad Vingård, a resort and vineyard with a Michelin-starred restaurant on its property, where patrons can take guided vineyard tours before heading to dinner or enjoying an underwater sauna. The estate specialises in sparkling wine; winemaker Claes Bartoldsson estimates they've churned out around 25,000 bottles this year. The plan is to eventually multiply that production number by 10. \"Last year we had the biggest harvest here ever and the rest of Europe was a disaster,\" said Bartoldsson, citing reports of flooding, hail and diseases down south.","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/38bgYq2HqasR7wCRMPUXc0/374e0858ee5096966ff623cf6c174b22/arcticwine.png"}}},{"content":{"sys":{"id":"55MmerdI0JcwWtUK9Fg921"},"slug":"/8","title":"The 'pasta revolution' sweeping Italy","description":"On the shores of Lake Garda, Italian chef Riccardo Camanini is bringing ancient Italian recipes – like cacio e pepe – into the modern day at his restaurant Lido 84.\n\nA female pig's bladder is preferable to a male pig's bladder when cooking rigatoni cacio e pepe en vessie (cheese and pepper rigatoni pasta cooked inside a pig's bladder) – the signature dish of chef Riccardo Camanini. This is due to the \"greater elasticity\", Camanini explained. The use of a bladder as a cooking vessel means that the pasta is steamed rather than boiled, and is fully immersed in the other ingredients – the pecorino cheese, salt, pepper and extra virgin olive oil – while it's cooking. But it also means that the dish never tastes the same twice.\n\n\"The bladder is the constant imperfection,\" Camanini said. \"Even if we just use female bladders, 35cm horizontal and 41cm vertical, they're never the same. One might be deeper, or more elastic, or one may be six months older than another. The dish lives on that imperfection.\"\n\nBefore serving the cacio e pepe, the pasta-filled bladder is brought to the guest's table in a golden dish. It's then cut open from bottom to top to reveal the creamy rigatoni inside and send the scent of the pecorino wafting through the air.\n\nOne piece of rigatoni from each batch of pasta always goes back to the kitchen for Camanini to taste. \"This is because it's always different,\" Camanini said. \"And there's a joy in la repetition du geste (the repetition of a gesture). It's something which keeps the passion in an artisan job alive.\"\n\nCamanini is the head chef and co-owner, along with his brother Giancarlo, of Lido 84. The restaurant opened in 2014 and earned a Michelin star six months later. As recently as July 2022, it was ranked the eighth best restaurant in the world on The World's 50 Best Restaurants list by a panel of culinary experts.\n\nThe restaurant sits on an idyllic inlet on Lake Garda, behind which lemon, olive, camphor and cypress trees layer into the mountains that steeply rise to the rugged peak of Monte Lavino. Lido 84's relaxed patio looks out over the lake, all the way to the region of Veneto. Inside, floor-to-ceiling windows treat guests to the same view.\n\nCacio e pepe is \"one of the most traditional pastas from Rome\", Camanini said. This was a key consideration when he was creating his version of the dish, and it's part of a wider trend in contemporary Italian cuisine that is taking Italian cuisine back to its roots. \n\n\"There is a new generation of Italian chefs who want to bring their heritage to their cuisine, and Riccardo Camanini is part of that,\" said Eleanora Cozzella, author of Pasta Revolution and an academy chair at The World's 50 Best Restaurants. \"Dry pasta has always been popular in Italy, but it wasn't used in haute cuisine until 12-15 years ago. It was something to feed the family – a poor ingredient. Now there is pride in it. There's a pasta revolution; a new knowledge of the history, of the production process and of different ways to cook it; in wine, tea or stock for example – or in a bladder.\"\n\nThe inspiration for Riccardo Camanini to cook the pasta in a pig's bladder originally came from Apicius, an ancient Roman text that includes the use of bladders in a variety of its (often essay-length) recipes. \"That book influenced me a lot,\" Camanini said.\n\nCooking en vessie means that the chef's work is done not at the stove, but on the chopping board. Once the ingredients are in the bladder and it's on the boil it's out of Camanini's hands. \"The end result is more pungent and acidic,\" said Cozzella.\n\nCamanini first witnessed cooking en vessie while working with Jean Louis Nomicos, Alan Ducasse's right-hand man, in Paris in the '90s. \"I had the chance to make, and taste, la volaille de Bresse en vessie,\" he said. \"It's a French plate from the 18th Century. The chef put a chicken into a pig's bladder – with truffle, foie gras, le Madère (Madeira wine) and other ingredients.\"\n\n\"The idea was to recreate one of Italy's most iconic dishes – pasta.\"\nWith his cacio e pepe, Camanini wanted to pay homage to this technique, rooted in Italian heritage.\n\n\"So, the idea was to recreate one of Italy's most iconic dishes – pasta,\" he said. \"As an Italian, I represent pasta, and so I saw a challenge in creating a recipe from what Mr Apicius wrote.\" Dry pasta wouldn't have existed when Apicius lived, Camanini added. \"It was only after 1200 CE, when commerce started from Sicily, that it became necessary,\" he said. \"But it was fun to imagine Apicius cooking this dish.\" \n\nThe biggest difference between Camanini's cacio e pepe and la volaille de Bresse en vessie is the cost of the ingredients. Whereas the latter is an incredibly expensive dish, cacio e pepe is quite the opposite. It's a humble meal, with origins in the huts of shepherds outside Rome. Camanini has \"brought a nobility to this traditional dish\", said Cozzella, and crucially, a focus on the quality of those core ingredients.\n\nLido 84's pecorino cheese comes from the coastal plain of Maremma Laziale in the region of Lazio. Their grey salt comes from Guérande, in France's Pays de la Loire region. The black pepper is Sarawak, often considered among the finest in the world, from Borneo.\n\n\"Eating the cacio e pepe is like a story, or a poem,\" said Camanini. \"We are touched by these artisan suppliers we meet and their passion, and our food becomes a story we want to share.\"\n\nCamini does not believe that a signature dish defines a chef. \"I love each of my sons equally,\" he said of the options on his menu. But in many ways, his cacio e pepe en vessie – simple yet complex, indulgent yet sophisticated and deeply artisanal – describes the story of his life-long relationship to food.\n\nCamanini was born in Sovere, near the lush Lake Iseo, a lesser-visited lake two-hour's drive from Lake Garda. \"We didn't have roots in gastronomy,\" said Camanini, \"but we did have roots in agriculture.\"\n\nFrom an early age, Camanini learned the importance of homegrown produce.\n\n\"Every year on 2 January, our family of 12-15 people would sit down to eat osso di maiale (pork bones),\" he recalled. \"Each family would have one or two pigs which would be killed at the start of November to produce salami, after the first nebbia (fog) of winter or autumn.\"","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/xcmtFSPoqaWy1MPMtu9lm/66602bd476550c4d2d41a7469315ee0a/cacciopepe.png"}}},{"content":{"sys":{"id":"1UzaaAcgkHEIAbR0VJdcif"},"slug":"/7","title":"What happened to wild salmon?","description":"Sally Ferns Barnes' wild smoked salmon is beloved by epicureans, yet the dwindling numbers of the fish in Irish rivers mean it becomes rarer with every passing year.\n\nThis year, Sally Ferns Barnes will take just 225 wild Atlantic salmon into her tiny smokery in West Cork, Ireland. Last year it was 370. She is the last person in Ireland to exclusively smoke wild fish. \n\nThe salmon will be fished from the Blackwater River by Mikey Walsh and Eamon Uniacke, who continue a tradition laid down by generations of their families. Walsh is a fifth-generation salmon fisherman, but low quota means less income, so he also drives the local school bus and tends a farm. Uniacke rents out bouncy castles and has a coach hire business.\n\nBarnes smoked her first fish in 1979: mackerel, over an old tea chest with wood chippings and a damp sackcloth. Her then-husband, Colin, was a fisherman; he'd bring home mackerel, crayfish, lobster, crab and salmon. Some of the catch would feed them and their two children; whatever remained, Barnes preserved to sell or barter with neighbours in exchange for potatoes and seasonal gluts. Life in Ireland's coastal villages was hard, and these communities sustained each other by sharing food.\n\nThe last year Colin fished for salmon at sea, in 1979, he didn't get paid. His buyer, after negotiating a price for the salmon, took the entire catch, prepared, smoked and sold the lot, and then drank every penny away. After paying for crew and provisions, Barnes and Colin were left hopelessly in debt. The buyer eventually handed over a kiln in partial restitution for the money owed, which Barnes used to teach herself how to cold-smoke salmon.\n\nCold smoking is a delicate method of preserving fish. Unlike hot smoking, which cooks the fish and results in a product with a short shelf life, cold smoking is more akin to dehydration, extending shelf life for months. Wood is set to smoke at a low temperature away from a chamber where salt-cured fish is hung. Smoke travels along a pipe into the chamber, gently enveloping the wild fish in a preserving vapour of smoke, forcing out moisture and preserving flavour. Cold-smoking fish is a labour-intensive process, from the preparation of the fillets to salt curing and smoking. It results in a food of high skill, high regard and high value, and is an ideal income generator for fisher-families during leaner winter months when harsh weather frequently rolls in off the Atlantic Ocean forcing small fishing boats to tie up and wait it out.\n\nOver time, Barnes' Irish Wild Smoked Salmon drew acclaim by chefs and caught the eye of food award judges. In 2006, it was selected as Supreme Champion at the Great Taste Awards from more than 6,000 entrants; and in 2013, renowned Irish chef Richard Corrigan praised it in Daily Telegraph Magazine as \"the best food present anyone had ever given him\".\n\nSalt, smoke and time are the only ingredients Barnes uses to transform the wild salmon into a much-desired food. It's meltingly butter-soft in the mouth, lightly licked with beech smoke and sea salt. Glossy with hues of pale coral and barely-there marbling are hallmarks of true wild salmon. It lacks a pungent fishiness; the delicate, floral aroma belies an elegant and gently lingering flavour. It's best eaten on well-buttered brown soda bread with a strong cup of tea.\n\nIt's a perennial favourite artisan product beloved by epicureans, yet the dwindling numbers of salmon under Barnes' hands mean her Irish Wild Smoked Salmon becomes rarer with every passing year.\n\nAs the only fish whose lifecycle demands a transition from salt to fresh water, over-fishing at sea coupled with poor environmental land management practices polluting inland waterways, have wreaked untold damage to both habitats. Decimation of terminal moraine gravel beds, which were formed in the last ice age and are essential to the spawning habits of salmon is another factor.\n\nIn Ireland, a total ban on sea fishing of wild salmon was imposed in 2007, restricting fishing to rivers where salmon return to spawn. However, between 2007 and 2017, Barnes didn't want to take fish from the often-polluted Irish rivers and the corrupted quality of the salmon there. Instead, Barnes sourced her salmon from Usan Fisheries in the town of East Montrose in her native Scotland, for 10 years until that fishery closed, too.\n\nIn that time, regulation of Irish rivers had improved, but there was still no salmon quota in rivers local to her in Skibbereen, County Cork. One hundred kilometres east of her Woodcock Smokery, where the mighty Blackwater River divides County Cork and County Waterford on the south-east coast, became Barnes's new salmon hunting ground. Using draught and snap nets, Walsh and Uniacke fish their quota of salmon – which is just 225 this year – and every fish goes to Barnes.\n\n\"I'm very protective of them,\" she said of Walsh and Uniacke, but also of the fish they net for her.\n\nThe commercial salmon fishery opens from mid-May. Weeks before, Barnes feels an intuitive call to the salmon – a trigger for her own migration from the smokery to the Blackwater. \"I get a frisson. I can smell 'em; they're coming,\" she said.","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/2DPUAMIRIdPxRifCW8AfSx/9e7c43e7b1af7e8984e437dc4dd2b950/wildsalmon.png"}}},{"content":{"sys":{"id":"60A23GTcXkKngDQF7GyYhb"},"slug":"/9","title":"The world's oldest sourdough?","description":"The search for the oldest sourdough starter spans continents and countries, science labs and libraries, and involves everyone from the Ancient Egyptians to Jesus Christ.\n\nDuring the pandemic, many people hunkered down and explored the art of making bread for the first time.

But the story is a whole lot spicier than that.\n\nTake a wander down any condiment aisle in France these days, and you'll notice a pervasive absence between la mayo and le ketchup. Since this May, France has faced a widespread dearth of Dijon mustard, leading one French resident to advertise two jars for sale to the tune of €6,000 or about £5,000 (since revealed to be merely in jest). The shortage has incited expats (this author included) to not-at-all-jokingly smuggle squeeze bottles of Maille back into the country from places like the US to get their fix, while author and Paris resident David Lebovitz even resorted to hunting his jars down at a local gardening store, of all places.\n\nWhile French news outlets wasted no time in attributing the shortage to the war in Ukraine, the real story is a whole lot spicier than that.\n\nOmnipresent on French tables, Dijon mustard, made by combining brown mustard seeds with white wine, is a beloved condiment that provides a counterpoint to rich, hearty dishes thanks to its acidity and heat. It's the perfect accompaniment to a slice of crisp-skinned roast chicken, the ideal way to jazz up a simple ham-and-butter sandwich and an essential ingredient in homemade mayonnaise.\n\nThat the condiment is so anchored in France's Burgundy region – of which Dijon is the capital city – is thanks to the historical co-planting of brown mustard seeds with the region's renowned grapevines, a practice introduced by the Ancient Romans to provide the vines with essential nutrients like phosphorous. Monks continued to cultivate mustard in this fashion for centuries, and, in 1752, the link between Dijon and mustard was cemented thanks to Dijon local Jean Naigeon, who married the seeds, not with vinegar, but with verjuice – the juice of unripe wine grapes historically used to add a pleasantly sour flavour to recipes in regions inhospitable to citrus.\n\nDijon mustard stands out from other mustards on the market for its subtle, balanced flavour. Packing more heat than American yellow mustard but less than powerful Chinese mustard or Bavarian senf, it capitalises on the pungency of the mustard seed by marrying it with the pleasant acidity of local Burgundian verjuice or, in most contemporary iterations, white wine.\n\nBut the truth is that despite its historical link the to the region, Dijon mustard has been delocalised for quite some time.\n\nAfter Burgundian farmers largely abandoned mustard cultivation in favour of higher-paying crops decades ago, moutardiers (mustard makers) began looking further afield for the tiny seed at the root of the condiment that launched 1,000 \"Pardon me, sir\" jokes. Their mustard seed needs were chiefly met by Canada, which produces about 80% of the world's supply. But this winter, Canadian-grown mustard also dried up, when, after several years of declining production had reduced stores, dry summer weather obliterated the Canadian crop, sending mustard seed prices skyrocketing threefold.\n\nThough the shortage was not caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it was exacerbated by it, impacting Dijon mustard makers \"indirectly\", according to Luc Vandermaesen, CEO of mustard producer Reine de Dijon. Rather than the brown seeds required for Dijon, Ukraine predominantly produces the white variety used in yellow and English mustard. Given the conflict, producers less tied to specific mustard varieties turned to Canada's already meagre supply, intensifying the shortage.\n\nInadvertently, this all shed new light on the discrepancy between the name \"Dijon mustard\" and where it's made. After all, unlike Champagne or Roquefort, the \"Dijon\" in Dijon mustard refers to a specific recipe and not to a geographic region protected by an Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) or Appellation d'Origine Protégée (AOP) designation, which regulate products like wine, cheese and even lentils with an iron fist.\n\n\"There are no rules keeping the production of Dijon mustard in [the city of] Dijon,\" said Sophie Mauriange of the Institut National de l'Origine et de la Qualité (INAO), the governing board that controls the AOC and AOP labels in France. \"You can make it anywhere in the world.\"","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/1qed40iUXT2BKD9y1s5J5J/dc9c07a5bc5eff4c3982bdb50f6d0c8d/dijon.png"}}}]},"__N_SSG":true}
