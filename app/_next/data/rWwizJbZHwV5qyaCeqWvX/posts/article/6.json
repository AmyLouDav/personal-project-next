Climate change really has become drastic and it's affecting agriculture in a very severe way.\"\n\nIn recent years, heat waves, drought and smoke from wildfires have wreaked havoc on vineyards around Europe, making it increasingly difficult to produce the same legacy wines that producers have consistently been churning out for centuries. Last year, southern European winemakers faced historically low harvests due to bad weather.\n\nSerner suggested heading up to her home country of Sweden and setting up a vineyard on the island of Gotland, a southern province with warm, mild summers where her grandmother owned a summerhouse.\n\nBut Guerra wasn't sure. \"He had never heard of Gotland,\" Serner said, \"He asked, 'What is it? Are there polar bears?' You know, all the southern European myths about Sweden came up. And then he started asking very intricate questions about soil composition, climate, air humidity, UV radiation and the average temperature. After quite a while, he said he was still very sceptical, but there is potential.\"\n\nThey took a leap of faith, and today, Serner and Guerra are the co-founders of Långmyre Vineri – a 10-acre vineyard on Gotland, with a collection of 26,000 vines. They are part of a small yet growing cohort of Swedish winemakers whose collective land area spans between 370 to 500 acres. \"It was really just a fantasy,\" admitted Serner. \"But things kind of escalated quite quickly.\"\n\nAs the world gets hotter, cool climate viticulture is becoming increasingly attractive. Since the late 1800s, the average global temperature has risen about 1C, which might seem incremental but has significant repercussions for the wine industry. \"A 2C global increase in temperature could remove 55% of wine growing regions worldwide and 4C could remove over 70% of these regions from production,\" said Debbie Inglis, the director of the Cool Climate Oenology and Viticulture Institute in Canada, citing a 2020 study.\n\nOnce seen as experimental and at the fringe of what's possible, a commercial wine industry in regions just below the Arctic circle is taking advantage of the warmer summers. In the last decade, southern Sweden, Denmark, Nova Scotia in Canada and even parts of Norway have become emerging wine destinations, a development spurred by hotter summers and the introduction of disease-resistant hybrid grape varieties that can resist the frigid winters.\n\n\"During the last 20 years, we've had the opportunity to harvest grapes on yearly basis,\" said Lotta Nordmark, a horticulturist and researcher at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, about the Swedish wine industry. \"In earlier years when you tried to grow wine in Sweden, it wasn't guaranteed that you could get a good harvest every year.\"\n\nSweden has been dabbling in viticulture since 1999, but wine makers didn't start hitting their stride until around 2010 when cold-hardy hybrid grapes like Solaris were introduced via Germany, according to Sveneric Svensson, the chairman of the Swedish Wine Association. \"Solaris was born in Frankfurt, but it's really too warm for it there,\" Svensson said. \"In Sweden, because it's colder, it's got a slow and nice development that doesn't ripen that brutally.\"\n\nFrom an environmental standpoint, hybrid grapes are disease resistant cultivars that don't require much or any pesticides or fungicides – the main reason why Serner and Guerra decided to set up shop in southern Sweden instead of Italy. \"We firmly believe that these hybrid varieties are the future of sustainable wine growing,\" said Serner. \"People are so fixated with making the same wine from the same varieties, even though the recipe that was written 200 years ago was made when the world looked different.\"\n\nIn old wine countries like Italy and France, there are strict appellation rules dictating what type of grapes can be grown and where. But the problem is that with the changing climate, some of these legacy grapes no longer thrive as well as they did before.\n\n\"If you grow the conventional varieties, you can try to be organic, but you will have to spray at one point because they will get sick,\" said Serner. \"We didn't want to be locked in that situation.\" Many emerging wine regions, on the other hand, do not have regulations on grapes – a freedom that many winegrowers find to be more sustainable in the long run.\n\nOn Sweden's largest vineyard, Arilds Vingård, head winemaker Joe Roman estimates that 90% of their grapes are of the Solaris variety, which can be made into bright white or sparkling wines with high levels of acidity. Roman, who grew up in California and studied wine making in Oregon, also chose to work in the Swedish wine industry because of its predilection for hybrids. \"It's much better for the planet. You spray much less,\" he said.\n\nLocated on a peninsula in southern Sweden, Arilds looks like a classic European vineyard. Rows of perfectly manicured vines sit neatly on 74 acres of land; a cluster of glamping tents for guests is situated in the middle. Near the entrance, a restaurant and bar is packed with visitors in sundresses and cargo pants sipping on a range of estate-made white, sparkling and rosé wines.\n\nAnd they're not the only ones offering an all-inclusive experience. Further north in the neighbouring province is Ästad Vingård, a resort and vineyard with a Michelin-starred restaurant on its property, where patrons can take guided vineyard tours before heading to dinner or enjoying an underwater sauna. The estate specialises in sparkling wine; winemaker Claes Bartoldsson estimates they've churned out around 25,000 bottles this year. The plan is to eventually multiply that production number by 10. \"Last year we had the biggest harvest here ever and the rest of Europe was a disaster,\" said Bartoldsson, citing reports of flooding, hail and diseases down south.","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/38bgYq2HqasR7wCRMPUXc0/374e0858ee5096966ff623cf6c174b22/arcticwine.png","description":"The Arctic Circle: A new frontier for sustainable wine"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
