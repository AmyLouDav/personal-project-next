Last year it was 370. She is the last person in Ireland to exclusively smoke wild fish. \n\nThe salmon will be fished from the Blackwater River by Mikey Walsh and Eamon Uniacke, who continue a tradition laid down by generations of their families. Walsh is a fifth-generation salmon fisherman, but low quota means less income, so he also drives the local school bus and tends a farm. Uniacke rents out bouncy castles and has a coach hire business.\n\nBarnes smoked her first fish in 1979: mackerel, over an old tea chest with wood chippings and a damp sackcloth. Her then-husband, Colin, was a fisherman; he'd bring home mackerel, crayfish, lobster, crab and salmon. Some of the catch would feed them and their two children; whatever remained, Barnes preserved to sell or barter with neighbours in exchange for potatoes and seasonal gluts. Life in Ireland's coastal villages was hard, and these communities sustained each other by sharing food.\n\nThe last year Colin fished for salmon at sea, in 1979, he didn't get paid. His buyer, after negotiating a price for the salmon, took the entire catch, prepared, smoked and sold the lot, and then drank every penny away. After paying for crew and provisions, Barnes and Colin were left hopelessly in debt. The buyer eventually handed over a kiln in partial restitution for the money owed, which Barnes used to teach herself how to cold-smoke salmon.\n\nCold smoking is a delicate method of preserving fish. Unlike hot smoking, which cooks the fish and results in a product with a short shelf life, cold smoking is more akin to dehydration, extending shelf life for months. Wood is set to smoke at a low temperature away from a chamber where salt-cured fish is hung. Smoke travels along a pipe into the chamber, gently enveloping the wild fish in a preserving vapour of smoke, forcing out moisture and preserving flavour. Cold-smoking fish is a labour-intensive process, from the preparation of the fillets to salt curing and smoking. It results in a food of high skill, high regard and high value, and is an ideal income generator for fisher-families during leaner winter months when harsh weather frequently rolls in off the Atlantic Ocean forcing small fishing boats to tie up and wait it out.\n\nOver time, Barnes' Irish Wild Smoked Salmon drew acclaim by chefs and caught the eye of food award judges. In 2006, it was selected as Supreme Champion at the Great Taste Awards from more than 6,000 entrants; and in 2013, renowned Irish chef Richard Corrigan praised it in Daily Telegraph Magazine as \"the best food present anyone had ever given him\".\n\nSalt, smoke and time are the only ingredients Barnes uses to transform the wild salmon into a much-desired food. It's meltingly butter-soft in the mouth, lightly licked with beech smoke and sea salt. Glossy with hues of pale coral and barely-there marbling are hallmarks of true wild salmon. It lacks a pungent fishiness; the delicate, floral aroma belies an elegant and gently lingering flavour. It's best eaten on well-buttered brown soda bread with a strong cup of tea.\n\nIt's a perennial favourite artisan product beloved by epicureans, yet the dwindling numbers of salmon under Barnes' hands mean her Irish Wild Smoked Salmon becomes rarer with every passing year.\n\nAs the only fish whose lifecycle demands a transition from salt to fresh water, over-fishing at sea coupled with poor environmental land management practices polluting inland waterways, have wreaked untold damage to both habitats. Decimation of terminal moraine gravel beds, which were formed in the last ice age and are essential to the spawning habits of salmon is another factor.\n\nIn Ireland, a total ban on sea fishing of wild salmon was imposed in 2007, restricting fishing to rivers where salmon return to spawn. However, between 2007 and 2017, Barnes didn't want to take fish from the often-polluted Irish rivers and the corrupted quality of the salmon there. Instead, Barnes sourced her salmon from Usan Fisheries in the town of East Montrose in her native Scotland, for 10 years until that fishery closed, too.\n\nIn that time, regulation of Irish rivers had improved, but there was still no salmon quota in rivers local to her in Skibbereen, County Cork. One hundred kilometres east of her Woodcock Smokery, where the mighty Blackwater River divides County Cork and County Waterford on the south-east coast, became Barnes's new salmon hunting ground. Using draught and snap nets, Walsh and Uniacke fish their quota of salmon – which is just 225 this year – and every fish goes to Barnes.\n\n\"I'm very protective of them,\" she said of Walsh and Uniacke, but also of the fish they net for her.\n\nThe commercial salmon fishery opens from mid-May. Weeks before, Barnes feels an intuitive call to the salmon – a trigger for her own migration from the smokery to the Blackwater. \"I get a frisson. I can smell 'em; they're coming,\" she said.","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/2DPUAMIRIdPxRifCW8AfSx/9e7c43e7b1af7e8984e437dc4dd2b950/wildsalmon.png","description":"The last of Ireland's rare wild salmon"}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
