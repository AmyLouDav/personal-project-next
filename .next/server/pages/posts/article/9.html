During the pandemic, many people hunkered down and explored the art of making bread for the first time. Some used dry active yeast or baking soda to find that perfect rise, while others dabbled in the wild world of sourdough starters.

But home bakers didn&#x27;t just learn about making bread in its most natural form – they tapped into living antiquity. Sourdough starters, often referred to as mother dough, have a nearly 6,000-year history that spans the globe and are responsible for feeding the planet millions of times over. 

This captivates bread-makers, scientists and researchers who want to understand how this elixir of life came about and what makes it so special – especially when the starter&#x27;s owner claims a long and storied history. Because of this fascination, old starters have an almost mystical quality to them, and finding them and baking with them have gripped home cooks and professionals around the world.
