{"pageProps":{"blogData":{"content":{"slug":"/2","title":"An epic food journey in the Arctic Circle","description":"Fabled for its off-the-beaten track location, gourmet restaurant Koks is now even harder to reach. It has uprooted from the Faroe Islands, and until 2023, moved to a small village in western Greenland that's located more than 200km inside the Arctic Circle.\n\nHere, rugged nature serves up a wild harvest of seafood and game, from prawns and halibut to reindeer and muskox (a horned and shaggy-haired bovine that resembles a bison).\n\nFaroese chef Poul Andrias Ziska honed his craft in the harsh North Atlantic but has now reimagined his signature locavore cooking for a Greenlandic terroir.\n\nCrispy shrimp heads with beady eyes and antennae; delicately smoked salmon sandwiched between bubbly fish-skin crackers; and tender morsels of scarlet-red ptarmigan (a bird found in mountainous northern climes) breast skewered with a white-feathered wing bone are among the dishes awaiting curious diners who seek out a table at the only Michelin-starred restaurant in the Arctic.\n\nGreenland, like the Faroe Islands, is an autonomous Danish territory. Eighty percent of its enormous landmass is covered by a vast ice sheet and glaciers, while its tiny 56,000 population mostly lives along the coast.\n\n\"We have been thinking a lot about doing something in Greenland, because I've always found it very fascinating,\" said Ziska, who had long hoped to host an event or pop-up in the country together with other regional chefs. Meanwhile, a catalogue of problems with the premises back home was a tipping point that motivated him to relocate. \"[Greenland is] similar, but then again so very different to where we come from.\"","image":{"url":"https://images.ctfassets.net/jnyuf76defm3/4nrTjzq3UJpqFKNfiRJQqH/83bede93352ce56074a25b495ab902b1/iceberg.png","description":"The breath-taking voyage to Ilimanaq zigzags through a maze of towering icebergs "}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
